## Default Analysis

This challenge proposes the creation of a predictive model that calculates the probability of default for recurring customers on new credit applications. For this, 3 relational databases are provided containing information about customers and their transactions. The goal is to use this information to build a credit score model that helps companies make credit approval or denial decisions.
