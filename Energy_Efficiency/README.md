# Energy Efficiency

This project aims to study the relationships between physical parameters of buildings and the power required to cool and heat them. The goal is to build machine learning models to predict these energy variables. This topic is important because it is directly related to energy efficiency, which is a critical issue in the current context of energy generation and consumption within a country. The dataset used in this study was constructed by the [Center of Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://cml.ics.uci.edu/) in Irvine, California. It consists of 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotech. A total of 768 building shapes were generated, each with its own dimensions and estimated heat and cooling load values.
