# Solar Power Generation Prediction:
Nowadays, the amount of energy consumed has sharply increased. As a result, the human race has been investing more and more in renewable energy due to concerns about the environment and global warming. Therefore, in parallel with the increase in consumption, it is also evident in some countries that photovoltaic energy and wind energy are taking their place in the energy matrix. With this in mind, this project aims to analyze and predict the generation of solar power plants using the dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
