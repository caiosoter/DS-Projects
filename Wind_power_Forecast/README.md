# Wind power forecasting

## Problem Summary

This project addresses the critical need for accurate wind power forecasting, driven by the increasing reliance on wind energy as a key component of sustainable energy portfolios. The inherent variability of wind patterns poses a significant challenge in maintaining a stable and reliable energy supply. Accurate forecasting is essential for optimizing grid operations, ensuring efficient energy distribution, and maximizing the economic viability of wind energy projects. By improving forecast accuracy, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding energy storage, dispatch, and trading, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of wind power integration into the energy grid.
