# Wind power forecasting
Wind energy is the energy of the wind transformed into useful energy through wind turbines. This renewable energy source is widely used because it is an alternative to fossil energy, it is clean, does not produce greenhouse gases and can generally be used in various locations, however there are still some environmental and social problems attached, such as soil compaction and the noise emitted by the blades. In addition, wind energy suffers a lot from the fluctuation of winds and, therefore, doors are opened for the application of Machine Learning models to be used to make generation forecasts. Finally, this project aims to forecast the wind power generation of a wind turbine located in Germany with historical data from 2011 to the end of 2021.
