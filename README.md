My repository for projects that I have accomplished during my jouney to become a Data Scientist. Most of them will be related to energy because I have a feeling that humans can sove many important energy problems using data and Machine Learning, thus, solving these types of problems will bring great impact to society. Although my background is in Electrical Engineering, I will be exploring different subjects during my career as a Data Scientist as well.
