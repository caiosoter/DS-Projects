# Data Science Projects
My repository for projects that I have accomplished during my journey to become a Data Scientist. Most of them will be related to energy because of my background and also because I have a feeling that humans could solve many important problems regarding energy using data and Machine Learning. Thus, solving these types of problems will bring a great impact to society. Although my background is in Electrical Engineering, I will be exploring different subjects during my career as a Data Scientist as well.
